After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, the Stewards found that after the 300 Metres ALCARI commenced to lay out under pressure and passing the 150 Metres and again close to the 100 Metres, METRO WARRIOR was struck over the nose by the whip of J Moreira. The Stewards ascertained that at about the 150 Metres METRO WARRIOR was racing in the vicinity of a long neck behind ALCARI. The Stewards further found that passing the 100 Metres ALCARI shifted out and inconvenienced METRO WARRIOR. ALCARI then again shifted out and near the 30 Metres bumped METRO WARRIOR which became unbalanced. Having regard to the manner in which the two horses were finishing the race off and the short head margin between ALCARI and METRO WARRIOR at the end of the race, the Stewards were satisfied that if not for METRO WARRIOR becoming unbalanced when bumped by ALCARI, METRO WARRIOR would have finished in front of ALCARI. Accordingly, the protest/objection was sustained and the placings amended to read No. 2, METRO WARRIOR, 1st; No. 5, ALCARI, 2nd; No. 8, RUN RUN COOL, 3rd, and No. 1, GOLD CHEST, 4th. At a subsequent inquiry, J Moreira was advised to ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground in similar circumstances.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on STRIKING MR C at the request of Trainer T P Yung. The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse’s trachea. Before being allowed to race again, STRIKING MR C will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of GOLD CHEST immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
METRO WARRIOR and ALCARI were sent for sampling."

Approaching the 900 Metres, ARMOUR EAGLE got its head on the side and lay in when awkwardly placed behind TEAM SPIRIT. COMPASSION SPIRIT, which was following ARMOUR EAGLE, was shifted in away from the heels of that horse, resulting in DOUBLE SIX POP being momentarily inconvenienced.
Passing the 800 Metres, DOUBLE SIX POP got its head up when being steadied away from the heels of RACING FIGHTER when continuing to prove difficult to settle. DOUBLE SIX POP then continued to be awkwardly placed behind RACING FIGHTER for some distance.
After the 400 Metres, COMPASSION SPIRIT was shifted out away from the heels of DOUBLE SIX POP which, when held up for clear running, shifted out.
Passing the 100 Metres, DOUBLE SIX POP was directed out away from the heels of CALIFORNIA SKY which shifted out.

RACING FIGHTER shifted out at the start and bumped the hindquarters of ARMOUR EAGLE which then became unbalanced, shifted out and brushed TEAM SPIRIT which in turn shifted out and inconvenienced COMPASSION SPIRIT.
From a wide barrier, BEAUTY MISSION was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
In the early stages, DOUBLE SIX POP, from the outside barrier, travelled keenly when being steadied to obtain cover.
When being steadied to obtain cover passing the 900 Metres, HANDSOME TWELVE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of GALLANT EXPRESS (V Borges) which shifted in when not fully clear. V Borges was advised to exercise more care when shifting ground.
Approaching the 900 Metres, ARMOUR EAGLE got its head on the side and lay in when awkwardly placed behind TEAM SPIRIT. COMPASSION SPIRIT, which was following ARMOUR EAGLE, was shifted in away from the heels of that horse, resulting in DOUBLE SIX POP being momentarily inconvenienced.
Passing the 800 Metres, DOUBLE SIX POP got its head up when being steadied away from the heels of RACING FIGHTER when continuing to prove difficult to settle. DOUBLE SIX POP then continued to be awkwardly placed behind RACING FIGHTER for some distance.
After the 400 Metres, COMPASSION SPIRIT was shifted out away from the heels of DOUBLE SIX POP which, when held up for clear running, shifted out.
Passing the 100 Metres, DOUBLE SIX POP was directed out away from the heels of CALIFORNIA SKY which shifted out.
Also passing the 100 Metres, COMPASSION SPIRIT was shifted out away from the heels of HANDSOME TWELVE which shifted out. Then over the concluding stages, COMPASSION SPIRIT raced in restricted room between HANDSOME TWELVE and BEAUTY MISSION.
Throughout the race, GALLANT EXPRESS travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, J Moreira (ARMOUR EAGLE) stated that after being held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight, he directed ARMOUR EAGLE to the inside of TEAM SPIRIT approaching the 300 Metres with a view to improving into tight running between that horse and CALIFORNIA SKY. He said as he was attempting to improve into this run passing the 300 Metres, ARMOUR EAGLE lay in towards the heels of CALIFORNIA SKY which approaching the 250 Metres shifted out.

When being steadied in an attempt to obtain cover in the early stages, SEA MONARCH proved very difficult to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions. SEA MONARCH then travelled wide and without cover throughout. Mr W Y So, the trainer of SEA MONARCH, explained that as the horse had not been finishing its races off when ridden in a forward position, he directed M L Yeung from the outside barrier to steady SEA MONARCH in the early stages and obtain cover in the hope that being ridden more patiently would allow the horse the opportunity to finish the race off better than it had been of late.

When questioned regarding the performance of BRAVE POWER, C Y Ho stated that after obtaining a position in about midfield in the early stages, BRAVE POWER was not suited by the moderate tempo of the race in the middle stages. He said he was following SMILING FACE after the 900 Metres and when that horse was awkwardly placed behind runners in front, this resulted in BRAVE POWER being taken back through the field and rounding the Home Turn was positioned towards the tail of the field. He said he attempted to shift BRAVE POWER to the outside of runners in the early part of the Straight as BRAVE POWER has finished off its races when able to obtain clear and uninterrupted running, however, due to DESTIN being positioned to BRAVE POWER’s outside rounding the Home Turn, he was unable to shift his mount to the outside of runners. He said whilst he was able to ride BRAVE POWER out in the Straight, the horse was reluctant to fully stretch out when having to race behind runners. He added that near the 100 Metres he was able to shift BRAVE POWER to the outside of SEA MONARCH and after this BRAVE POWER made up some ground. He said whilst the horse’s run today appeared disappointing, he was of the opinion that the circumstances of the race resulted in BRAVE POWER not being able to finish off the race strongly.

INGENIOUS FELLOW shifted out at the start and bumped BRAVE POWER.
DRAGON PRIDE shifted out towards the heels of ALL BEST FRIENDS on jumping.
From a wide barrier, VICTORIOUS LEADER was steadied in the early stages to obtain cover.
Passing the 1300 Metres, GO GO SIXTEEN was awkwardly placed close to the heels of ALL BEST FRIENDS which shifted in before being directed out abruptly to relieve the crowding to GO GO SIXTEEN.
When being steadied in an attempt to obtain cover in the early stages, SEA MONARCH proved very difficult to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions. SEA MONARCH then travelled wide and without cover throughout. Mr W Y So, the trainer of SEA MONARCH, explained that as the horse had not been finishing its races off when ridden in a forward position, he directed M L Yeung from the outside barrier to steady SEA MONARCH in the early stages and obtain cover in the hope that being ridden more patiently would allow the horse the opportunity to finish the race off better than it had been of late.
Throughout the race, ALL BEST FRIENDS also travelled wide and without cover.
After the 800 Metres, SMILING FACE was awkwardly placed behind INGENIOUS FELLOW.
Near the 750 Metres, INGENIOUS FELLOW shifted out away from the heels of SEIZE THE SPIRIT when travelling keenly, resulting in ALL BEST FRIENDS being taken wider.
Near the 650 Metres, INGENIOUS FELLOW shifted out and bumped the hindquarters of ALL BEST FRIENDS, resulting in both INGENIOUS FELLOW and ALL BEST FRIENDS becoming unbalanced and INGENIOUS FELLOW shifting in and bumping VICTORIOUS LEADER.
Approaching the 500 Metres, BRAVE POWER raced tight between DESTIN and DRAGON PRIDE which shifted out away from the heels of SMILING FACE.
Approaching the 300 Metres, DRAGON PRIDE was shifted to the inside of VICTORIOUS LEADER to obtain clear running.
Passing the 300 Metres, GO GO SIXTEEN was hampered when taken wider by ALL BEST FRIENDS which was carried out by INGENIOUS FELLOW (L Ferraris) which shifted out. L Ferraris was told to ensure that in similar circumstances he makes more effort to correct his mounts than he did on this occasion. SMILING FACE, which was following ALL BEST FRIENDS, was inconvenienced in consequence when disappointed for running between that horse and GO GO SIXTEEN.
At the 250 Metres, VICTORIOUS LEADER was directed out away from behind SEIZE THE SPIRIT to obtain clear running.
When questioned regarding the performance of BRAVE POWER, C Y Ho stated that after obtaining a position in about midfield in the early stages, BRAVE POWER was not suited by the moderate tempo of the race in the middle stages. He said he was following SMILING FACE after the 900 Metres and when that horse was awkwardly placed behind runners in front, this resulted in BRAVE POWER being taken back through the field and rounding the Home Turn was positioned towards the tail of the field. He said he attempted to shift BRAVE POWER to the outside of runners in the early part of the Straight as BRAVE POWER has finished off its races when able to obtain clear and uninterrupted running, however, due to DESTIN being positioned to BRAVE POWER’s outside rounding the Home Turn, he was unable to shift his mount to the outside of runners. He said whilst he was able to ride BRAVE POWER out in the Straight, the horse was reluctant to fully stretch out when having to race behind runners. He added that near the 100 Metres he was able to shift BRAVE POWER to the outside of SEA MONARCH and after this BRAVE POWER made up some ground. He said whilst the horse’s run today appeared disappointing, he was of the opinion that the circumstances of the race resulted in BRAVE POWER not being able to finish off the race strongly.

Near the 750 Metres, INGENIOUS FELLOW shifted out away from the heels of SEIZE THE SPIRIT when travelling keenly, resulting in ALL BEST FRIENDS being taken wider.
Near the 650 Metres, INGENIOUS FELLOW shifted out and bumped the hindquarters of ALL BEST FRIENDS, resulting in both INGENIOUS FELLOW and ALL BEST FRIENDS becoming unbalanced and INGENIOUS FELLOW shifting in and bumping VICTORIOUS LEADER.
Approaching the 500 Metres, BRAVE POWER raced tight between DESTIN and DRAGON PRIDE which shifted out away from the heels of SMILING FACE.
Approaching the 300 Metres, DRAGON PRIDE was shifted to the inside of VICTORIOUS LEADER to obtain clear running.
Passing the 300 Metres, GO GO SIXTEEN was hampered when taken wider by ALL BEST FRIENDS which was carried out by INGENIOUS FELLOW (L Ferraris) which shifted out. L Ferraris was told to ensure that in similar circumstances he makes more effort to correct his mounts than he did on this occasion. SMILING FACE, which was following ALL BEST FRIENDS, was inconvenienced in consequence when disappointed for running between that horse and GO GO SIXTEEN.
At the 250 Metres, VICTORIOUS LEADER was directed out away from behind SEIZE THE SPIRIT to obtain clear running.
When questioned regarding the performance of BRAVE POWER, C Y Ho stated that after obtaining a position in about midfield in the early stages, BRAVE POWER was not suited by the moderate tempo of the race in the middle stages. He said he was following SMILING FACE after the 900 Metres and when that horse was awkwardly placed behind runners in front, this resulted in BRAVE POWER being taken back through the field and rounding the Home Turn was positioned towards the tail of the field. He said he attempted to shift BRAVE POWER to the outside of runners in the early part of the Straight as BRAVE POWER has finished off its races when able to obtain clear and uninterrupted running, however, due to DESTIN being positioned to BRAVE POWER’s outside rounding the Home Turn, he was unable to shift his mount to the outside of runners. He said whilst he was able to ride BRAVE POWER out in the Straight, the horse was reluctant to fully stretch out when having to race behind runners. He added that near the 100 Metres he was able to shift BRAVE POWER to the outside of SEA MONARCH and after this BRAVE POWER made up some ground. He said whilst the horse’s run today appeared disappointing, he was of the opinion that the circumstances of the race resulted in BRAVE POWER not being able to finish off the race strongly.
A veterinary inspection of GO GO SIXTEEN and BRAVE POWER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
BRAVE POWER, SUPER KIN and DRAGON PRIDE were sent for sampling."

ORIENTAL SMOKE began awkwardly, shifted out and bumped the hindquarters of BEAUTY CHEERS which was momentarily awkwardly placed inside the heels of WHIZZ KID.
MEDIC ELITE shifted in at the start and bumped FORTUNE MASTER, causing both horses to become unbalanced.
SPARKLING DOLPHIN and HAPPY FOREVER bumped at the start due to both horses shifting ground. This resulted in both horses becoming unbalanced.
Near the 950 Metres, SPARKLING DOLPHIN got its head on the side and shifted out when being ridden along, resulting in HAPPY FOREVER being hampered when racing in restricted room inside GLENEALY GENERALS.
Near the 450 Metres, GLENEALY GENERALS was steadied away from the heels of SPARKLING DOLPHIN when disappointed for running to the inside of that horse which, after hanging out, was corrected by its rider and shifted in marginally. After this, GLENEALY GENERALS was awkwardly placed close to the heels of SPARKLING DOLPHIN before being shifted to the outside of that horse passing the 400 Metres.
For some distance approaching and passing the 400 Metres, HAPPY FAT CAT lay out under pressure and inconvenienced HAPPY FOREVER and approaching the 200 Metres also inconvenienced SPARKLING DOLPHIN, resulting in the rider of HAPPY FAT CAT having to stop riding his mount and correct HAPPY FAT CAT. GLENEALY GENERALS, which was following SPARKLING DOLPHIN, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse in consequence. Passing the 300 Metres, HAPPY FOREVER was directed to the inside of HAPPY FAT CAT as that horse shifted out. HAPPY FOREVER was then inconvenienced by HAPPY FAT CAT when that horse was corrected near the 200 Metres. After this, HAPPY FOREVER was held up for clear running behind HAPPY FAT CAT and because of this was not able to be fully tested.
H T Mo (SPARKLING DOLPHIN) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that by riding his mount along when it was laying out approaching the 300 Metres, he failed to take sufficient measures to prevent SPARKLING DOLPHIN from shifting out, causing GLENEALY GENERALS, which was endeavouring to improve to the outside of SPARKLING DOLPHIN, to be severely checked and lose the running to which it was entitled to improve into. H T Mo was suspended from riding in races for a period to commence on Sunday, 6 February 2022 and to expire on Thursday, 10 February 2022 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays). In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into account Jockey Mo’s good race riding record.
After the 150 Metres, MEDIC ELITE improved into tight running to the outside of GORGEOUS VITALITY.
Close to the finishing line, NOBLE DESIRE was awkwardly placed close to the heels of EIGHT TRIGRAMS.

The Stewards tonight interviewed Trainer J Size regarding the improved performance of HEZA BEAUTY in this race. Mr Size said HEZA BEAUTY has a well-documented history in respect of barrier issues and which has resulted in the horse having to give up too much start in a number of its races. He said he had been reluctant to add the blinkers to HEZA BEAUTY in the past as he believed that this piece of equipment would not assist the horse in behaving better in the barriers. He said however that at its most recent starts HEZA BEAUTY had improved its barrier manners and given the horse had raced disappointingly in those races, he believed that HEZA BEAUTY may benefit from the addition of blinkers at this stage of its career. He said in this race HEZA BEAUTY began very well and due to the blinkers was able to obtain a good position in the early stages without having to be made use of. He said because of these factors HEZA BEAUTY was then able to finish off the race better than it had been at its recent starts."

Shortly after the start, CLASSIC POSH and MONEY CATCHER bumped as a result of both horses shifting ground. After this, CLASSIC POSH was shifted across behind runners.
From the outside barriers, THE HULK, BEAUTY NOVA and CRAIG’S STAR were all shifted across behind runners in the early stages to obtain cover.
Approaching the 900 Metres, PARTERRE was left racing wide and without cover.
Approaching and passing the 900 Metres, PRIVATE ROCKET commenced to prove very difficult to settle and after being checked away from the heels of HEZA BEAUTY for some distance then shifted out away from the heels of that horse, resulting in KASI FARASI being checked passing the 800 Metres when crowded for room inside MONEY CATCHER. As the Stewards formed the opinion that PRIVATE ROCKET’s racing manners at this time resulted in the horse shifting out away from the heels of HEZA BEAUTY rather than the rider of that horse shifting out unnecessarily, no further action was taken.
YO BEAUTY was held up for clear running from shortly after entering the Straight until after the 300 Metres. CLASSIC POSH, which was following YO BEAUTY, also had some difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight.
HEZA BEAUTY was held up for clear running from near the 400 Metres until after the 300 Metres.
Near the 250 Metres, BEAUTY NOVA was steadied when disappointed for running between HURRY HURRY GAIN and PRIVATE ROCKET which was taken in by MONEY CATCHER.
THE HULK was unable to obtain clear running in the Straight until passing the 100 Metres. Because of this, THE HULK was unable to be properly tested.
Throughout the race, MONEY CATCHER travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, M Chadwick was not able to offer any valid reason for the disappointing performance of BEAUTY CHAMP which after leading today’s race then did not finish the race off over the concluding stages. A veterinary inspection of BEAUTY CHAMP immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
The Stewards will interview Trainer J Size regarding the improved performance of the winner HEZA BEAUTY prior to the Happy Valley racemeeting to be conducted on Wednesday, 12 January 2022.

The Stewards tonight interviewed Trainer J Size regarding the improved performance of HEZA BEAUTY in this race. Mr Size said HEZA BEAUTY has a well-documented history in respect of barrier issues and which has resulted in the horse having to give up too much start in a number of its races. He said he had been reluctant to add the blinkers to HEZA BEAUTY in the past as he believed that this piece of equipment would not assist the horse in behaving better in the barriers. He said however that at its most recent starts HEZA BEAUTY had improved its barrier manners and given the horse had raced disappointingly in those races, he believed that HEZA BEAUTY may benefit from the addition of blinkers at this stage of its career. He said in this race HEZA BEAUTY began very well and due to the blinkers was able to obtain a good position in the early stages without having to be made use of. He said because of these factors HEZA BEAUTY was then able to finish off the race better than it had been at its recent starts."

He said he had been reluctant to add the blinkers to HEZA BEAUTY in the past as he believed that this piece of equipment would not assist the horse in behaving better in the barriers. He said however that at its most recent starts HEZA BEAUTY had improved its barrier manners and given the horse had raced disappointingly in those races, he believed that HEZA BEAUTY may benefit from the addition of blinkers at this stage of its career. He said in this race HEZA BEAUTY began very well and due to the blinkers was able to obtain a good position in the early stages without having to be made use of. He said because of these factors HEZA BEAUTY was then able to finish off the race better than it had been at its recent starts."
