TOMODACHI KOKOROE shifted in at the start and bumped CHEVAL VALIANT.
HAPPY DAILY jumped only fairly, shifted out and bumped with BRILLIANT LIFE.
CHATEAU was slow to begin.
RUN RUN COOL and INVINCIBLE SAGE were crowded on jumping between MAN STAR and PLEASANT ENDEAVOR, both of which shifted ground.
Approaching the 800 Metres, DROPS OF GOD was steadied to avoid the heels of TOMODACHI KOKOROE which was taken out by CHEAVL VALIANT (Apprentice Y L Chung). Apprentice Chung was reprimanded.
From the 400 Metres, INVINCIBLE SAGE was held up for clear running behind PLEASANT ENDEAVOR. Approaching the 200 Metres, INVINCIBLE SAGE (H Bowman) then improved into a doubtful run between BRILLIANT LIFE and PLEASANT ENDEAVOR, resulting in INVINCIBLE SAGE making contact with the hindquarters of PLEASANT ENDEAVOR, turning that runner in which resulted in INVINCIBLE SAGE being checked and taken in onto BRILLIANT LIFE and making heavy contact with BRILLIANT LIFE when that runner was racing tight to the outside of RED ELEGANCE which, after being crowded by CHEVAL VALIANT, was taken out slightly by that runner. H Bowman was severely reprimanded and advised he must ensure that there is sufficient racing room when improving into runs. Apprentice Chung was reprimanded and advised that he must stop riding and straighten his mounts sooner than what he did on this occasion.
When questioned regarding the performance of RED ELEGANCE, Z Purton stated that although his mount was crowded passing the 200 Metres, it was under pressure at that point and was finding it difficult to finish the race off. He said, in his opinion, RED ELEGANCE, which was only having its second race start, is still somewhat immature and did not appreciate the strong pace set throughout the middle stages of the event. A veterinary inspection of RED ELEGANCE immediately following the race which included an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucus in the horse’s trachea.
A veterinary inspection of BRILLIANT LIFE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
RED ELEGANCE, FLYING HIGH and PLEASANT ENDEAVOR were sent for sampling.
<8/5/2023 Additional Veterinary Reports> BRILLIANT LIFE, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said at that time there were no significant findings. BRILLIANT LIFE was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer C H Yip this morning. He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its left front leg with a bone injury to the left knee. Before being allowed to race again, BRILLIANT LIFE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination."

Approaching the 200 Metres, INVINCIBLE SAGE (H Bowman) then improved into a doubtful run between BRILLIANT LIFE and PLEASANT ENDEAVOR, resulting in INVINCIBLE SAGE making contact with the hindquarters of PLEASANT ENDEAVOR, turning that runner in which resulted in INVINCIBLE SAGE being checked and taken in onto BRILLIANT LIFE and making heavy contact with BRILLIANT LIFE when that runner was racing tight to the outside of RED ELEGANCE which, after being crowded by CHEVAL VALIANT, was taken out slightly by that runner. H Bowman was severely reprimanded and advised he must ensure that there is sufficient racing room when improving into runs. Apprentice Chung was reprimanded and advised that he must stop riding and straighten his mounts sooner than what he did on this occasion.
When questioned regarding the performance of RED ELEGANCE, Z Purton stated that although his mount was crowded passing the 200 Metres, it was under pressure at that point and was finding it difficult to finish the race off. He said, in his opinion, RED ELEGANCE, which was only having its second race start, is still somewhat immature and did not appreciate the strong pace set throughout the middle stages of the event. A veterinary inspection of RED ELEGANCE immediately following the race which included an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucus in the horse’s trachea.
A veterinary inspection of BRILLIANT LIFE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
RED ELEGANCE, FLYING HIGH and PLEASANT ENDEAVOR were sent for sampling.
<8/5/2023 Additional Veterinary Reports> BRILLIANT LIFE, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said at that time there were no significant findings. BRILLIANT LIFE was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer C H Yip this morning. He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its left front leg with a bone injury to the left knee.

As the start was effected, SUPERB BOY, which was being assisted by a starting gate handler, lifted its front feet off the ground and consequently lost a significant amount of ground. Before being allowed to race again, SUPERB BOY will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial.
MAJESTIC KNIGHT shifted out at the start and bumped QUADRUPLE DOUBLE.
SINGAPORE SUNSHINE began very awkwardly and then was crowded for room on jumping between MAGIC TORONADO and GOLDEN WARSTEED which shifted out.
BRILLIANT WAY and FLYING DRAGON bumped at the start.
M Chadwick (KA YING SPIRIT) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that passing the 900 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of RUN RUN COOL, resulting in RUN RUN COOL being crowded for room and taken out onto BRILLIANT WAY and making contact with that horse, causing BRILLIANT WAY to shift out onto FLYING DRAGON which resulted in FLYING DRAGON being taken out across the rightful running of GOLDEN WARSTEED which was badly hampered and taken out across MAGIC TORONADO which was severely checked. FLYING DRAGON then continued to shift out, resulting in GOLDEN WARSTEED also being severely checked. M Chadwick was suspended from riding in races for a period to commence on Sunday, 1 January 2023 and to expire on Thursday, 5 January 2023 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays). In addition, Jockey Chadwick was fined $30,000.
Over the concluding stages, FLYING DRAGON raced tight outside SUPERB BOY.

M Chadwick (KA YING SPIRIT) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that passing the 900 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of RUN RUN COOL, resulting in RUN RUN COOL being crowded for room and taken out onto BRILLIANT WAY and making contact with that horse, causing BRILLIANT WAY to shift out onto FLYING DRAGON which resulted in FLYING DRAGON being taken out across the rightful running of GOLDEN WARSTEED which was badly hampered and taken out across MAGIC TORONADO which was severely checked. FLYING DRAGON then continued to shift out, resulting in GOLDEN WARSTEED also being severely checked. M Chadwick was suspended from riding in races for a period to commence on Sunday, 1 January 2023 and to expire on Thursday, 5 January 2023 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).

Passing the 200 Metres, EQUALETTA BLITZ was momentarily eased away from the heels of ROCK YA HEART which shifted in.
Approaching and passing the 100 Metres, HARMONY AND RICH raced in restricted room between PING HAI GALAXY and EQUALETTA BLITZ which shifted out.
Close to the finishing line, PING HAI GALAXY was shifted in away from the heels of HANDSOME BO BO (H Bentley) which shifted in under pressure. H Bentley was reprimanded and told to ensure that he makes more endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground in similar circumstances than he did on this occasion.
For the majority of the race, PING HAI GALAXY travelled wide and without cover.
A veterinary inspection of CLASSIC UNICORN and SEIZING THE MOMENT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

After the race, M Chadwick stated that following CLASSIC UNICORN’s failure to finish the race off, he was of the opinion that the horse may be better suited in races conducted at Happy Valley at this stage of its career. A veterinary inspection of CLASSIC UNICORN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
Also after the race, A Badel stated that, in his opinion, ATOMIC FORCE raced disappointingly today. He said ATOMIC FORCE travelled only fairly in the early stages and after being ridden along prior to the 500 Metres did not respond as he anticipated.

STOLTZ and SPECIAL M then raced tight for a short distance after the start between EXPLOSIVE WITNESS and ROCK YA HEART which got its head on the side and shifted in when unbalanced. Then near the 950 Metres, ROCK YA HEART was crowded for room between SCORES OF FUN and STOLTZ which shifted out.
Passing the 950 Metres, WE THE SOUTH was shifted out away from the heels of CLASSIC UNICORN which shifted out when being ridden along.
Approaching the 900 Metres, STOLTZ became unbalanced when bumped by SPECIAL M which was taken out by MCLUCKY.
Near the 650 Metres, RUN RUN COOL was momentarily crowded for room between MCLUCKY and WE THE SOUTH, both of which shifted ground.
Near the 450 Metres, EXPLOSIVE WITNESS and SCORES OF FUN raced tight as EXPLOSIVE WITNESS shifted out when awkwardly placed close to the heels of ROCK YA HEART. This resulted in both EXPLOSIVE WITNESS and SCORES OF FUN becoming unbalanced.
Passing the 300 Metres, ROCK YA HEART shifted out a number of runners to obtain clear running. ROCK YA HEART and SPECIAL M then raced tight passing the 200 Metres.
Approaching the 250 Metres, WE THE SOUTH raced tight inside MCLUCKY which shifted in.
EXPLOSIVE WITNESS was held up for clear running over the final 100 Metres and approaching the winning post was checked away from the heels of CLASSIC UNICORN. Because of this, EXPLOSIVE WITNESS was not able to be properly tested.
Throughout the race, both MCLUCKY and METRO WARRIOR travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, Z Purton stated that, in his opinion, carrying top weight from barrier 8 resulted in STOLTZ not being able to finish the race off tonight, particularly given that the horse has not raced since towards the end of April. He said he had to ride his mount along in the early stages to get as forward a position as possible, however, was required to race in the second half of the field. He said STOLTZ travelled only fairly in the early and middle stages and after coming under heavy pressure rounding the Home Turn then did not finish the race off. A veterinary inspection of STOLTZ immediately following the race found that horse to be lame in its right front leg. Before being allowed to race again, STOLTZ will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
After the race, A Hamelin advised the Veterinary Officer that SCORES OF FUN coughed on a number of occasions on pulling up. A veterinary inspection of SCORES OF FUN immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse’s trachea. Before being allowed to race again, SCORES OF FUN will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of LUCKY MORE immediately following the race found that horse to be a ""roarer” which had previously been reported.

Approaching the 900 Metres, STOLTZ became unbalanced when bumped by SPECIAL M which was taken out by MCLUCKY.
Near the 650 Metres, RUN RUN COOL was momentarily crowded for room between MCLUCKY and WE THE SOUTH, both of which shifted ground.
Near the 450 Metres, EXPLOSIVE WITNESS and SCORES OF FUN raced tight as EXPLOSIVE WITNESS shifted out when awkwardly placed close to the heels of ROCK YA HEART. This resulted in both EXPLOSIVE WITNESS and SCORES OF FUN becoming unbalanced.

EXPLOSIVE WITNESS was held up for clear running over the final 100 Metres and approaching the winning post was checked away from the heels of CLASSIC UNICORN. Because of this, EXPLOSIVE WITNESS was not able to be properly tested.
Throughout the race, both MCLUCKY and METRO WARRIOR travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, Z Purton stated that, in his opinion, carrying top weight from barrier 8 resulted in STOLTZ not being able to finish the race off tonight, particularly given that the horse has not raced since towards the end of April. He said he had to ride his mount along in the early stages to get as forward a position as possible, however, was required to race in the second half of the field. He said STOLTZ travelled only fairly in the early and middle stages and after coming under heavy pressure rounding the Home Turn then did not finish the race off. A veterinary inspection of STOLTZ immediately following the race found that horse to be lame in its right front leg. Before being allowed to race again, STOLTZ will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
After the race, A Hamelin advised the Veterinary Officer that SCORES OF FUN coughed on a number of occasions on pulling up. A veterinary inspection of SCORES OF FUN immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse’s trachea. Before being allowed to race again, SCORES OF FUN will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

STOLTZ and SPECIAL M then raced tight for a short distance after the start between EXPLOSIVE WITNESS and ROCK YA HEART which got its head on the side and shifted in when unbalanced. Then near the 950 Metres, ROCK YA HEART was crowded for room between SCORES OF FUN and STOLTZ which shifted out.
Passing the 950 Metres, WE THE SOUTH was shifted out away from the heels of CLASSIC UNICORN which shifted out when being ridden along.
Approaching the 900 Metres, STOLTZ became unbalanced when bumped by SPECIAL M which was taken out by MCLUCKY.
Near the 650 Metres, RUN RUN COOL was momentarily crowded for room between MCLUCKY and WE THE SOUTH, both of which shifted ground.
Near the 450 Metres, EXPLOSIVE WITNESS and SCORES OF FUN raced tight as EXPLOSIVE WITNESS shifted out when awkwardly placed close to the heels of ROCK YA HEART. This resulted in both EXPLOSIVE WITNESS and SCORES OF FUN becoming unbalanced.
Passing the 300 Metres, ROCK YA HEART shifted out a number of runners to obtain clear running. ROCK YA HEART and SPECIAL M then raced tight passing the 200 Metres.
Approaching the 250 Metres, WE THE SOUTH raced tight inside MCLUCKY which shifted in.
EXPLOSIVE WITNESS was held up for clear running over the final 100 Metres and approaching the winning post was checked away from the heels of CLASSIC UNICORN. Because of this, EXPLOSIVE WITNESS was not able to be properly tested.
Throughout the race, both MCLUCKY and METRO WARRIOR travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, Z Purton stated that, in his opinion, carrying top weight from barrier 8 resulted in STOLTZ not being able to finish the race off tonight, particularly given that the horse has not raced since towards the end of April. He said he had to ride his mount along in the early stages to get as forward a position as possible, however, was required to race in the second half of the field. He said STOLTZ travelled only fairly in the early and middle stages and after coming under heavy pressure rounding the Home Turn then did not finish the race off. A veterinary inspection of STOLTZ immediately following the race found that horse to be lame in its right front leg. Before being allowed to race again, STOLTZ will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
After the race, A Hamelin advised the Veterinary Officer that SCORES OF FUN coughed on a number of occasions on pulling up. A veterinary inspection of SCORES OF FUN immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse’s trachea. Before being allowed to race again, SCORES OF FUN will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of LUCKY MORE immediately following the race found that horse to be a ""roarer” which had previously been reported.
A veterinary inspection of RUN RUN COOL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Whilst the Stewards were of the opinion that a number of horses were shifting ground at this time which resulted in SEVEN HEAVENS being hampered, nonetheless V Borges was told to ensure that he reacts quicker to his mounts shifting ground than he did on this occasion.
After the race, V Borges stated that after being required to race wide and without cover throughout the race, SPECIAL M was then not able to finish the race off over the concluding stages. A veterinary inspection of SPECIAL M immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of AWESOME TREASURE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
WHIZZ KID and LIGHTNING STORM were sent for sampling.
<24/2/2022 Additional Veterinary Reports>The Veterinary Surgeon reported that LIGHTNING STORM was lame in its right front leg on the morning after racing. Before being allowed to race again, LIGHTNING STORM will be subjected to an official veterinary examination."

For this declaration error, C Y Ho was fined $2,000.
FAULDS began only fairly and then was bumped by ROYAL BOMB which shifted in after being bumped by STORM WARNINGS. After this, STORM WARNINGS was steadied to obtain cover from an outside barrier.
SEIZING THE MOMENT lost ground when crowded for room on jumping between RACING FIGHTER and HIGH RISE SOLDIER which shifted out.
Approaching the 900 Metres, RUN RUN COOL was awkwardly placed inside the heels of WAR OF COURAGE when being crossed by that horse.
DECISIVE TWELVE travelled wide and without cover until passing the 600 Metres at which point FAULDS was left racing wide and without cover.
Making the turn near the 500 Metres, RACING FIGHTER got its head on the side and lay out towards the heels of ROYAL BOMB.
Near the 450 Metres, WOOD ON FIRE raced tight outside HIGH RISE SOLDIER which improved to the outside of WAR OF COURAGE.
Rounding the Home Turn, FAULDS was bumped and taken wider by RUN RUN COOL which shifted out away from the heels of WOOD ON FIRE after having difficulty obtaining clear running.

Close to the finishing line, STORM WARNINGS was awkwardly placed behind DECISIVE TWELVE.
When questioned, K C Leung stated that he was instructed to ride WOOD ON FIRE in about a midfield position if possible. He said after beginning well, he immediately steadied his mount with a view to obtaining a position behind WAR OF COURAGE. He said as there were a number of horses positioned to the inside of WAR OF COURAGE which appeared as though they were going to take up positions in midfield or in advance of midfield, he felt that WOOD ON FIRE may have been left racing wide if he continued to steady his mount in an attempt to obtain a midfield position. He said as the tempo of the race in the early stages was not strong, he elected, rather than to continue to steady his mount, to ride WOOD ON FIRE along and clear runners to the inside which resulted in WOOD ON FIRE being ridden in a forward position today.

Passing the 400 Metres, WILD WEST WING became unbalanced when crowded for room between LIKE THAT and FLYING GENIUS which shifted in marginally.
Approaching the 150 Metres, GOLD CHEST was shifted in away from the heels of LIKE THAT.
The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in as they were of the prima facie view that an incident had occurred over the concluding stages of the race which cast sufficient doubt on whether ALCARI (J Moreira) should be declared the winner of the race. Subsequently, C Y Ho, the rider of METRO WARRIOR, second placegetter, lodged a protest/objection against ALCARI being declared the winner alleging interference to his mount over the latter stages. After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, the Stewards found that after the 300 Metres ALCARI commenced to lay out under pressure and passing the 150 Metres and again close to the 100 Metres, METRO WARRIOR was struck over the nose by the whip of J Moreira. The Stewards ascertained that at about the 150 Metres METRO WARRIOR was racing in the vicinity of a long neck behind ALCARI. The Stewards further found that passing the 100 Metres ALCARI shifted out and inconvenienced METRO WARRIOR. ALCARI then again shifted out and near the 30 Metres bumped METRO WARRIOR which became unbalanced. Having regard to the manner in which the two horses were finishing the race off and the short head margin between ALCARI and METRO WARRIOR at the end of the race, the Stewards were satisfied that if not for METRO WARRIOR becoming unbalanced when bumped by ALCARI, METRO WARRIOR would have finished in front of ALCARI. Accordingly, the protest/objection was sustained and the placings amended to read No. 2, METRO WARRIOR, 1st; No. 5, ALCARI, 2nd; No. 8, RUN RUN COOL, 3rd, and No. 1, GOLD CHEST, 4th. At a subsequent inquiry, J Moreira was advised to ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground in similar circumstances.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on STRIKING MR C at the request of Trainer T P Yung. The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse’s trachea. Before being allowed to race again, STRIKING MR C will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

The Stewards deferred the declaration of weighed-in as they were of the prima facie view that an incident had occurred over the concluding stages of the race which cast sufficient doubt on whether ALCARI (J Moreira) should be declared the winner of the race. Subsequently, C Y Ho, the rider of METRO WARRIOR, second placegetter, lodged a protest/objection against ALCARI being declared the winner alleging interference to his mount over the latter stages. After taking evidence from all parties concerned and after viewing the videos, the Stewards found that after the 300 Metres ALCARI commenced to lay out under pressure and passing the 150 Metres and again close to the 100 Metres, METRO WARRIOR was struck over the nose by the whip of J Moreira. The Stewards ascertained that at about the 150 Metres METRO WARRIOR was racing in the vicinity of a long neck behind ALCARI. The Stewards further found that passing the 100 Metres ALCARI shifted out and inconvenienced METRO WARRIOR. ALCARI then again shifted out and near the 30 Metres bumped METRO WARRIOR which became unbalanced. Having regard to the manner in which the two horses were finishing the race off and the short head margin between ALCARI and METRO WARRIOR at the end of the race, the Stewards were satisfied that if not for METRO WARRIOR becoming unbalanced when bumped by ALCARI, METRO WARRIOR would have finished in front of ALCARI. Accordingly, the protest/objection was sustained and the placings amended to read No. 2, METRO WARRIOR, 1st; No. 5, ALCARI, 2nd; No. 8, RUN RUN COOL, 3rd, and No. 1, GOLD CHEST, 4th. At a subsequent inquiry, J Moreira was advised to ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground in similar circumstances.
After the race, an endoscopic examination was conducted on STRIKING MR C at the request of Trainer T P Yung. The Veterinary Surgeon said this examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse’s trachea. Before being allowed to race again, STRIKING MR C will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of GOLD CHEST immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
METRO WARRIOR and ALCARI were sent for sampling."

GLORIFIED FIRE then shifted in when unbalanced, resulting in ENNEA FORTUNE striking the heels of that horse and stumbling. After this, ENNEA FORTUNE was shifted across behind runners.
SEIZING THE MOMENT began only fairly.
MOERAKI began awkwardly and then was hampered when crowded for room outside CORDYCEPS SIX which shifted out.
Approaching the 400 Metres, STOCK LEGEND, which was laying out, was awkwardly placed outside the heels of GLORIFIED FIRE which shifted out.
After being initially directed to the inside of RESOLUTE, ENNEA FORTUNE was shifted to the outside of that horse passing the 200 Metres as RESOLUTE shifted in under pressure. ENNEA FORTUNE was then held up for clear running when awkwardly placed behind GOOD VIEW CLARICO and outside RESOLUTE. Then approaching the 100 Metres, ENNEA FORTUNE (M Chadwick) was directed to the outside of GOOD VIEW CLARICO which resulted in MOERAKI being crowded for room. MOERAKI was then very awkwardly placed close to the heels of SUPER AXIOM as that horse gave ground over the concluding stages. Because of this, MOERAKI was not able to be tested over the final 150 Metres. M Chadwick was told that whilst there were some circumstances to this incident, namely ENNEA FORTUNE was held up for clear running and SUPER AXIOM was weakening in advance of MOERAKI, nonetheless he was reprimanded and told to exercise more care when shifting ground in similar circumstances. ENNEA FORTUNE was also not able to be properly tested over the concluding stages.
When questioned regarding the performance of NERVOUS WITNESS, Z Purton stated that his mount travelled very strongly in the early and middle stages. He said when CORDYCEPS SIX commenced to improve its position inside NERVOUS WITNESS passing the 400 Metres, he immediately became concerned as NERVOUS WITNESS did not quicken as it had for him in the past. He said he placed NERVOUS WITNESS under heavy pressure after the 300 Metres, however, the horse did not respond as he anticipated and then over the concluding stages finished off the race only fairly. He added NERVOUS WITNESS had barrier trialed well in the lead up to today’s race and its work, when ridden by him, had been good which indicated to him that the horse had not taken any adverse effects out of its most recent start in which NERVOUS WITNESS was placed under heavy pressure in the middle stages. He said however that based on the manner in which NERVOUS WITNESS failed to finish off today’s race, it may be that that race may have taken more out of the horse than he thought. Mr D A Hayes, trainer of NERVOUS WITNESS, said that, in his opinion, NERVOUS WITNESS had improved since its last run as the horse had trialed and worked extremely well. He said he had anticipated that NERVOUS WITNESS may take some time to recover from its last run, however, in the days subsequent to that run, NERVOUS WITNESS had pleased him and given the amount of time between that race and today’s race, he was not of the opinion that its last race had had any bearing on the horse’s disappointing performance today. He added at this time he was at a loss to explain the horse being beaten as he fully expected that it would again race successfully. A veterinary inspection of NERVOUS WITNESS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

Approaching the 400 Metres, STOCK LEGEND, which was laying out, was awkwardly placed outside the heels of GLORIFIED FIRE which shifted out.
After being initially directed to the inside of RESOLUTE, ENNEA FORTUNE was shifted to the outside of that horse passing the 200 Metres as RESOLUTE shifted in under pressure. ENNEA FORTUNE was then held up for clear running when awkwardly placed behind GOOD VIEW CLARICO and outside RESOLUTE. Then approaching the 100 Metres, ENNEA FORTUNE (M Chadwick) was directed to the outside of GOOD VIEW CLARICO which resulted in MOERAKI being crowded for room. MOERAKI was then very awkwardly placed close to the heels of SUPER AXIOM as that horse gave ground over the concluding stages. Because of this, MOERAKI was not able to be tested over the final 150 Metres. M Chadwick was told that whilst there were some circumstances to this incident, namely ENNEA FORTUNE was held up for clear running and SUPER AXIOM was weakening in advance of MOERAKI, nonetheless he was reprimanded and told to exercise more care when shifting ground in similar circumstances. ENNEA FORTUNE was also not able to be properly tested over the concluding stages.
When questioned regarding the performance of NERVOUS WITNESS, Z Purton stated that his mount travelled very strongly in the early and middle stages. He said when CORDYCEPS SIX commenced to improve its position inside NERVOUS WITNESS passing the 400 Metres, he immediately became concerned as NERVOUS WITNESS did not quicken as it had for him in the past. He said he placed NERVOUS WITNESS under heavy pressure after the 300 Metres, however, the horse did not respond as he anticipated and then over the concluding stages finished off the race only fairly. He added NERVOUS WITNESS had barrier trialed well in the lead up to today’s race and its work, when ridden by him, had been good which indicated to him that the horse had not taken any adverse effects out of its most recent start in which NERVOUS WITNESS was placed under heavy pressure in the middle stages. He said however that based on the manner in which NERVOUS WITNESS failed to finish off today’s race, it may be that that race may have taken more out of the horse than he thought. Mr D A Hayes, trainer of NERVOUS WITNESS, said that, in his opinion, NERVOUS WITNESS had improved since its last run as the horse had trialed and worked extremely well. He said he had anticipated that NERVOUS WITNESS may take some time to recover from its last run, however, in the days subsequent to that run, NERVOUS WITNESS had pleased him and given the amount of time between that race and today’s race, he was not of the opinion that its last race had had any bearing on the horse’s disappointing performance today. He added at this time he was at a loss to explain the horse being beaten as he fully expected that it would again race successfully.

GLORIFIED FIRE then shifted in when unbalanced, resulting in ENNEA FORTUNE striking the heels of that horse and stumbling. After this, ENNEA FORTUNE was shifted across behind runners.
SEIZING THE MOMENT began only fairly.
MOERAKI began awkwardly and then was hampered when crowded for room outside CORDYCEPS SIX which shifted out.
Approaching the 400 Metres, STOCK LEGEND, which was laying out, was awkwardly placed outside the heels of GLORIFIED FIRE which shifted out.
After being initially directed to the inside of RESOLUTE, ENNEA FORTUNE was shifted to the outside of that horse passing the 200 Metres as RESOLUTE shifted in under pressure. ENNEA FORTUNE was then held up for clear running when awkwardly placed behind GOOD VIEW CLARICO and outside RESOLUTE. Then approaching the 100 Metres, ENNEA FORTUNE (M Chadwick) was directed to the outside of GOOD VIEW CLARICO which resulted in MOERAKI being crowded for room. MOERAKI was then very awkwardly placed close to the heels of SUPER AXIOM as that horse gave ground over the concluding stages. Because of this, MOERAKI was not able to be tested over the final 150 Metres. M Chadwick was told that whilst there were some circumstances to this incident, namely ENNEA FORTUNE was held up for clear running and SUPER AXIOM was weakening in advance of MOERAKI, nonetheless he was reprimanded and told to exercise more care when shifting ground in similar circumstances. ENNEA FORTUNE was also not able to be properly tested over the concluding stages.
When questioned regarding the performance of NERVOUS WITNESS, Z Purton stated that his mount travelled very strongly in the early and middle stages. He said when CORDYCEPS SIX commenced to improve its position inside NERVOUS WITNESS passing the 400 Metres, he immediately became concerned as NERVOUS WITNESS did not quicken as it had for him in the past. He said he placed NERVOUS WITNESS under heavy pressure after the 300 Metres, however, the horse did not respond as he anticipated and then over the concluding stages finished off the race only fairly. He added NERVOUS WITNESS had barrier trialed well in the lead up to today’s race and its work, when ridden by him, had been good which indicated to him that the horse had not taken any adverse effects out of its most recent start in which NERVOUS WITNESS was placed under heavy pressure in the middle stages. He said however that based on the manner in which NERVOUS WITNESS failed to finish off today’s race, it may be that that race may have taken more out of the horse than he thought. Mr D A Hayes, trainer of NERVOUS WITNESS, said that, in his opinion, NERVOUS WITNESS had improved since its last run as the horse had trialed and worked extremely well. He said he had anticipated that NERVOUS WITNESS may take some time to recover from its last run, however, in the days subsequent to that run, NERVOUS WITNESS had pleased him and given the amount of time between that race and today’s race, he was not of the opinion that its last race had had any bearing on the horse’s disappointing performance today. He added at this time he was at a loss to explain the horse being beaten as he fully expected that it would again race successfully.

BLAZE WARRIOR was examined by the Veterinary Officer and passed suitable to race.
FANTASTIC SHOW was slow to begin.
CRAIG’S STAR was badly crowded for room on jumping between HELENA BABY which shifted in and ENCOURAGED which was taken out by KAI XIN DRAGON. In this incident, HELENA BABY became unbalanced when bumped on the hindquarters by CRAIG’S STAR and ENCOURAGED lost ground.
LINCOLN BRIGHT shifted out at the start and bumped the hindquarters of RUN RUN COOL. LINCOLN BRIGHT then shifted in and bumped WIN WIN FIGHTER which became unbalanced after initially being bumped on jumping by APACHE PASS which shifted out.
From wide barriers, WIN WIN FIGHTER and MASTER HERO were steadied to obtain cover in the early stages.
UNCLE STEVE was also steadied shortly after the start to obtain a position closer to the rail with cover.
LINCOLN BRIGHT travelled keenly for some distance after the 1200 Metres when being steadied to obtain cover behind APACHE PASS.
At the entrance to the Straight, CRAIG’S STAR was momentarily directed out away from the heels of HELENA BABY which shifted out.
Approaching the 300 Metres, TEAM POWER and BLAZE WARRIOR raced tight.
Close to the finishing line, TEAM POWER raced close to the heels of BLAZE WARRIOR.
Throughout the race, APACHE PASS travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, the Veterinary Officer reported that HELENA BABY had sustained a laceration to the left hind heel.

RUN RUN COOL shifted out at the start and bumped SEVEN HEAVENS. SEVEN HEAVENS and RUN RUN COOL were then hampered a short distance after the start by FLYING BONUS which shifted out.
A Hamelin (RESOLUTE) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that after the 1100 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of SEVEN HEAVENS, resulting in that horse having to be checked when unnecessarily crowded for room inside RESOLUTE and when being checked shifting in and bumping RUN RUN COOL. A Hamelin was suspended from riding in races for a period to commence on Thursday, 1 July 2021 and to expire on Monday, 5 July 2021 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays). In addition, Jockey Hamelin was fined $40,000.
Approaching the 700 Metres, RESOLUTE raced tight inside the heels of STRIKING MR C which got its head on the side and lay in.
After being bumped by SUNSET WATCH near the 650 Metres, RUN RUN COOL shifted out away from that horse, resulting in KAI XIN DRAGON being checked when crowded for room inside MEGA HEART. As the Stewards were of the opinion that this incident was attributable to RUN RUN COOL shifting out of its own accord rather than any rider carelessness, no further action was taken.
At the entrance to the Straight, STAR OF YUEN LONG attempted to improve into tight running between FLYING BONUS and RESOLUTE, resulting in STAR OF YUEN LONG bumping the hindquarters of RESOLUTE which caused both horses to become unbalanced. STAR OF YUEN LONG then continued to be awkwardly placed when attempting to improve into restricted room and near the 200 Metres was directed to the outside of RESOLUTE when disappointed for running between that horse and FLYING BONUS which shifted out when giving ground.
Throughout the race, MAN STAR and STRIKING MR C travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, it was reported that GUNNISON had lost its left hind plate.
Also after the race, Apprentice K H Chan stated that he had ridden FLYING BONUS in the lead up to today’s race and that work had been good. He said FLYING BONUS did not travel comfortably at any stage of the race. He said because of the manner in which the horse commenced to give ground in the early part of the Straight after being placed under pressure rounding the Home Turn, he was of the opinion that FLYING BONUS did not handle today’s track conditions. A veterinary inspection of FLYING BONUS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HARMONY SPIRIT, Apprentice C L Chau stated that he was instructed to follow SEVEN HEAVENS as it was felt that this was a horse that would be able to take HARMONY SPIRIT into the race. He said he had to ride his mount along in the early stages in an endeavour to follow SEVEN HEAVENS and, despite being ridden along, HARMONY SPIRIT was reluctant to maintain its position. He said he had to make a lot of use of HARMONY SPIRIT in the early stages in an endeavour to have it improve its position, however, HARMONY SPIRIT was resenting the kickback and was reluctant to improve. He added rounding the Home Turn he shifted HARMONY SPIRIT to the outside of runners and the horse finished off the race one-paced. He said HARMONY SPIRIT’s disappointing performance was solely attributable to the horse resenting the kickback on today’s track surface. A veterinary inspection of HARMONY SPIRIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of KAI XIN DRAGON immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

STAR OF YUEN LONG then continued to be awkwardly placed when attempting to improve into restricted room and near the 200 Metres was directed to the outside of RESOLUTE when disappointed for running between that horse and FLYING BONUS which shifted out when giving ground.
Throughout the race, MAN STAR and STRIKING MR C travelled wide and without cover.
After the race, it was reported that GUNNISON had lost its left hind plate.
Also after the race, Apprentice K H Chan stated that he had ridden FLYING BONUS in the lead up to today’s race and that work had been good. He said FLYING BONUS did not travel comfortably at any stage of the race. He said because of the manner in which the horse commenced to give ground in the early part of the Straight after being placed under pressure rounding the Home Turn, he was of the opinion that FLYING BONUS did not handle today’s track conditions. A veterinary inspection of FLYING BONUS immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HARMONY SPIRIT, Apprentice C L Chau stated that he was instructed to follow SEVEN HEAVENS as it was felt that this was a horse that would be able to take HARMONY SPIRIT into the race. He said he had to ride his mount along in the early stages in an endeavour to follow SEVEN HEAVENS and, despite being ridden along, HARMONY SPIRIT was reluctant to maintain its position. He said he had to make a lot of use of HARMONY SPIRIT in the early stages in an endeavour to have it improve its position, however, HARMONY SPIRIT was resenting the kickback and was reluctant to improve. He added rounding the Home Turn he shifted HARMONY SPIRIT to the outside of runners and the horse finished off the race one-paced. He said HARMONY SPIRIT’s disappointing performance was solely attributable to the horse resenting the kickback on today’s track surface. A veterinary inspection of HARMONY SPIRIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of KAI XIN DRAGON immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
SEVEN HEAVENS, MAN STAR and GUNNISON were sent for sampling."

When questioned, J Moreira stated that he was asked to ride ALL IN MIND in a forward position and it was anticipated that, from barrier 4, ALL IN MIND would be able to obtain a trailing position behind the leaders with cover. He said after being placed in the barriers, a number of runners became fractious which caused ALL IN MIND to also become fractious as the gates opened, resulting in the horse beginning only fairly and having to race back in the field.
